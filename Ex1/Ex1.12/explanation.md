```
What does the following for loop do? What is the final value of sum?
   int sum = 0;
   for (int i = -100; i <= 100; ++i)
      sum += i;
```

Initialize i to -100, increment i after each iteration, add the value of i to sum, keep incrementing until 100. I assume the sum will equal 0 since the negatives will cancel out the positive values.
