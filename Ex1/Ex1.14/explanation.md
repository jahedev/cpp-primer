Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?
```

For loop: you can initialize a value and increment on the same header line. It's better for iterating over some sort of list.
Both Loops: both loops can do everything the other can do.
While Loop: it's better for keeping the loop running until a certain condition is met, does not have to be iterating through a list.
